# LPT Lensing Comparison

The goal of this repo is to provide an open-source and easy-to-use testbed for comparing full-field weak lensing constraints under an LPT gravity model, lognormal convergence model, and gaussian convergence model. We adopt a setting emulating a small patch of LSST Y10 survey.

A guiding principle of this repo is that everything should be runnable within a few hours on colab.
