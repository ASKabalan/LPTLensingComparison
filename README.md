# LPT Lensing Comparison

The goal of this repo is to provide an open-source and easy-to-use testbed for comparing full-field weak lensing constraints under an LPT gravity model, lognormal convergence model, and gaussian convergence model. 

A guiding principle of this repo is that everything should be runnable within a few hours on colab.

## Description of forward model

We are adopting the following setting:
- patch size: 5 x 5 deg^2
- pixel size: 5 arcmin^2 (which gives us an lmax of around 3000)
- galaxy number density: 27 gals/arcmin^2
